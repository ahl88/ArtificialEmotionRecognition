Currently setup to be able to analyse any body of text you put in the "read" file.


First it negates useless words like "I", "my", "me", etc.


Then it uses remaining words and compares it with standard emotions list setup in "emotions". This
file can be updated or replaced with any number of emotion defining files. It currently uses
many different types of emotions but can be updated to only a basic set of 5 to make things easier.


It then provides count of total emotions analysed and a final emotion based on most frequent
detected.


Then it gives a sentinment rating of either positive or negative and the details on that.
I included a sample screenshot of analysis of a random speech.
